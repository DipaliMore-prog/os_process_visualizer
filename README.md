 OS Process Scheduler

> A modern, interactive web application for visualizing and simulating CPU process scheduling algorithms.

---

📖 Introduction

**OS Process Scheduler** is an educational web application that demonstrates how various CPU scheduling algorithms work in an operating system. It allows users to simulate process execution, visualize scheduling timelines, and compare algorithm performance based on key metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

The project is designed to help students, educators, and operating system enthusiasts understand process scheduling concepts through an intuitive and interactive interface instead of relying solely on theoretical explanations.

---

🎯 Objectives

* Visualize CPU scheduling algorithms in real time.
* Compare the performance of different scheduling techniques.
* Help students understand process management concepts in operating systems.
* Provide an interactive learning experience through simulation.
* Demonstrate scheduling results using easy-to-understand visualizations.

---

 ✨ Features

* Interactive CPU scheduling simulation
* Support for multiple scheduling algorithms
* Process creation with Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority
* Gantt Chart visualization
* Automatic calculation of:

  * Waiting Time
  * Turnaround Time
  * Completion Time
  * Response Time
  * Average Waiting Time
  * Average Turnaround Time
* Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
* Fast performance powered by Vite
* Modern and intuitive user interface
* Reusable React components
* Type-safe development using TypeScript
* Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS
